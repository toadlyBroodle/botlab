# Telemetry and Monitoring Guidelines

## Phoenix Telemetry
- The project uses Phoenix for telemetry monitoring
- Start the telemetry server with: `poetry run python -m phoenix.server.main serve`
- View telemetry data at http://localhost:6006
- Add `--telemetry` flag to CLI agent calls to enable their telemetry

## Best Practices
- Enable telemetry during development and testing to monitor agent performance
- Use telemetry data to identify bottlenecks or issues in agent workflows
- Consider telemetry impact on performance for production deployments
- Document any custom telemetry metrics or monitoring approaches

## Implementation
- When creating new agents, ensure they support the `--telemetry` flag
- Follow existing patterns for telemetry integration
- Use OpenTelemetry and OpenInference standards for instrumentation
