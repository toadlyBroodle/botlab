# Agent Projects Guidelines

## Common Structure
- Each agent project (researcher, manager, editor, writer_critic) should maintain its common file structure:
  - `__init__.py`
  - `agents.py`: Project agents
  - `example.py`: Example usages
  - `main.py`: Main setup and entry point
  - `tools.py`: Tools used by the agents

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Researcher Agent
- Located in *researcher/* directory
- Focuses on web search and information gathering
- Uses DuckDuckGo for web search, arXiv for academic papers
- Supports PDF to markdown conversion

### Manager Agent
- Located in *manager/* directory
- Coordinates multiple specialized agents
- Supports customizing agent descriptions and prompts via the --use-custom-prompts flag
- Custom configurations are defined in example.py

### Editor Agent
- Located in *editor/* directory
- Focuses on editing content with fact checking
- Internally uses fact_checker_agent as a subagent
- fact_checker_agent should not be used directly, only through editor_agent

### Writer-Critic Agent
- Located in *writer_critic/* directory
- Consists of writer agent for drafting and critic agent for feedback
- Supports iterative refinement through feedback

### Utils
- Located in *utils/* directory
- Contains shared utilities for all agent projects
- *gemini/* subdirectory contains Google Gemini LLM API utilities

## Customization Best Practices
- Preserve main.py files as they provide core functionality
- Create custom example files instead of modifying original example.py files
- Use configuration options like --use-custom-prompts or --config-file
- Define custom agent descriptions and prompts in custom example files
