# Smolagent Source Code Guidelines

- smolagent source code is located in *agents/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/smolagents/*
- Search this directory for information relevant to how smolagents works
- NEVER modify smolagent source code
- When referencing smolagent functionality, refer to the source code for accurate implementation details
- If you need to extend smolagent functionality, create wrapper classes or functions in the project's code rather than modifying the source
