# Terminal Command Execution Guidelines

## Command Execution Rules
- NEVER execute terminal commands automatically
- Present commands for user review before execution
- Provide clear explanations for what each command will do
- Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding with any command execution

## Best Practices
- Suggest commands with detailed explanations of their purpose and effects
- Break down complex operations into smaller, safer command steps
- Provide alternatives when possible
- Warn about potentially destructive commands (e.g., file deletion, overwriting)
- Respect user preferences for command execution
