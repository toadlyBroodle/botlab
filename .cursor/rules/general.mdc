# General Guidelines for Smolagent Projects

## Project Structure
- Never modify the structure of the project without explicit permission
- Each agent project (researcher, writer_critic, manager, editor) follows a common structure:
  - `__init__.py`
  - `agents.py`: Project agents
  - `example.py`: Example usages
  - `main.py`: Main setup and entry point
  - `tools.py`: Tools used by the agents

## Virtual Environment
- All Python scripts MUST be prefixed by `poetry run python`
- Example: `poetry run python -m researcher.example`
- Working directory for all commands should be the `agents/` directory

## Dependencies
- Never install new dependencies without asking user first
- Use the existing dependencies in pyproject.toml

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized

## Documentation
- Write clear docstrings for functions and classes
  - @tool docstrings are automatically added to agent system_prompts
- Do not write new example or README files unless asked to

## General
- Before adding unsolicited features, ask user before proceeding
